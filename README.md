This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Installation

Install packages.

# Init scripts

###### !!! available network names in hardhat.config.ts

Execute script:
```shell
 npx hardhat run ./scripts/init.ts --network "goerli"
```
